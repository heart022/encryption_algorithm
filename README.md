# encryption_algorithm
A little project I did where I made my own custom encryption and decryption algorithm in python!

# Context:
While this is not my first coding project, it is my first BIG coding project that I am very proud of. 
Since I put in a lot of effort into this, I decided to put it up on GitHub!
Worked on it from 3/24 -> 3/27 

# How do I run it?
So I didn't explicitly use a formal IDE to create this code, and I instead used Google Colab to create this
Just drop this code into a cell and run it directly! (All the helper methods and other stuff should be contained in the main file)
I tried to document this code as best as I could, and if anyone has any suggestions on how to make this code better (or more efficient lol), feel free to reach out to me on discord @heart022!
